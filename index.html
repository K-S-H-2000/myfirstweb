    <p>When we try to lose weight we have to take care of your <u>diet and exercise</u>.
    A diet and exercise plan should be <strong>consistent and sustainable</strong>.
    When you feel tired while in diet, you might have a cheating day in a week.
    But make sure not to eat too much when you are in cheating.
    I look forward to see your healthy body untill then let's be in serious.</p>
